<h2 align="center">DecryptR - 2017 (Python, Flask)</h2>
<p>This was created as part of an Internally Assessed Project (IAP) at school. It uses heuristics with local search algorithms (e.g. hill climbing, simulated annealing and genetic) to find solutions to classical ciphers when the key is unknown. It was initially made to tackle the National Cipher Challenge run by the University of Southampton but was later adapted to become my IAP project by turning it into a fully fledged website running Flask.</p>
